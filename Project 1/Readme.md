### Project 1: Explore Weather Trends
In this project, I will analyzed local and global temperature data and compared the temperature trends where I live to overall global temperature trends. My goal was to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city to where I live. To do this, I followed the steps below:

- Extract the data from the database. I had to export the temperature data for the world as well as for the closest big city to where I live. There was a list of citites in the city_list table. In order to interact with the database I had to write a SQL query.

- Download the CSV file and open it in Excel in order to create a line chart that compared my city's temperatures with the global temperatures. I had to make sure to plot the moving average rather than the yearly averages in order to smooth out the lines, making trends more observable.

- After creating the line chart, I made observations about the similarities and differences between the world averages and my cityâ€™s averages, as well as overall trends.
