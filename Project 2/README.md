### Project 2: Investigate a Dataset
For this project I chose one of Udacity's curated datasets and investigated it using NumPy and Pandas. The database I investigated was about medical appointment no show. The database contained 300k medical appointments and its 15 variables (characteristics) of each. The most important one if the patient show-up or no-show the appointment. To answer some questions using this database I had to go through the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question and finishing by sharing my findings.

After completing the project, I felt comfortable with:

- Knowing all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process.
- Posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions.
- Knowing how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use.
- Have practice communicating the results of your analysis.
- Be able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up your data analysis code.
- Be familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access your data more conveniently.
- Know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing your findings.
