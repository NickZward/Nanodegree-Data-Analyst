### Project 4: Wrangle and Analyze Data
Real-world data rarely comes clean. I used Python and its libraries to gather data from various sources and in a variety of formats. After gathering the data I assessed its quality and tidiness. After assessing the data I was able to clean the data. This process is called data wrangling. After the whole wrangling process I analyzed the Data and came up with three useful insights.

I used the following packages to complete this project:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Requests
- Tweepy
- Json
- Matplotlib
